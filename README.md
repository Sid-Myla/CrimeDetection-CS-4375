This study focuses on training machine learning
models for real-time crime detection using the
UCF Crime Dataset, a comprehensive collection
of real-world surveillance videos depicting crim-
inal activities. This dataset contains over 1900
video clips from multiple viewpoints, providing
a diverse range of scenarios and environmental
conditions. Our approach involved implement-
ing two different models and comparing how they
perform. The models implemented were a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and a 3D
Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) model.
The LSTM model processes sequential data which
aims to capture the temporal dynamics of criminal
activities, while the 3D CNN focuses on extract-
ing spatio-temporal features from video frames
and recognizing motion movements. By evaluat-
ing their performances, this project tries to deter-
mine the most effective machine learning archi-
tecture for real-time crime detection and provide
enhanced security measures.
